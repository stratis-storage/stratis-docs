*mulhern, Stratis Team*

Stratis 2.4.1 is a bug fix release, which addresses a flaw in the
multi-threading implementation.

A user could observe the behavior caused by the flaw when CLI commands would
either take far longer to complete than normal or the D-Bus connection would
eventually time out.

The cause of the observed problem was that stratisd was accepting a
GetManagedObjects call on the D-Bus but not returning the result. This
could occur when numerous object paths, i.e., several hundred, were being
supported on the D-Bus, generally due to the creation of many filesystems.

We have addressed this problem by:
* modifying the D-Bus message handling implementation
* implementing a custom ObjectManager class in the D-Bus layer

In addition, we have refined the method by which individual threads are
terminated when stratisd receives a shutdown signal to better terminate the
D-Bus message handling thread.

The stratisd 2.4.1 release includes one additional fix: the signals
associated with r4 D-Bus interfaces were not being sent appropriately,
now they are.

In addition, stratisd 2.4.1 includes logging, at the trace level, of lock
aquisitions and releases and additional logging in the systemd generators
included with the release.

The stratis-cli 2.4.1 release includes:
* an improvement to the listing of block devices
* a new report with key `managed_objects_report`

Previously, stratisd made use of the dbus-tokio crate to implement the
multi-threading aspects of D-Bus method handling. With this release, it no
longer depends on dbus-tokio, but handles the implementation using the
tokio crate directly.

Please consult the [stratisd] and [stratis] changelogs for additional
information about the 2.4.0 release.
