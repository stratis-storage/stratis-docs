### Stratis Description ###

Stratis is a tool to easily configure pools and filesystems with enhanced
storage functionality that works within the existing Linux storage
management stack.  To achieve this, Stratis prioritizes a straightforward
command-line experience, a rich API, and a fully automated approach to storage
management. It builds upon elements of the existing storage stack as much as
possible.  Specifically, Stratis uses device-mapper, LUKS, XFS, Clevis, and
may incorporate additional technologies in the future.

Stratis can configure an encrypted or unencrypted pool of storage with one or
more file systems quickly and without prior knowledge of the many storage
layers and commands.

Linux has a number of storage technologies that provide advanced functionality
to applications for accessing and storing data.  Examples of some of these
products that Stratis uses are:

* device-mapper - A framework for logical to physical mapping of data blocks
* LUKS          - An on disk format for encryption that can securely manages
                multiple passwords
* XFS           - A scalable, journaling, and performant filesystem
* Clevis        - A framework for automated decryption

Learning and gaining experience in a number of different storage technologies
can take many years.  Each of those technologies may have their own unique
command-line syntax, APIs, options, and logging.  Stratis simplifies this by
providing a single CLI and API for users to set up complex storage stacks
without having to spend time learning each independent storage technology.

### CLI Example ###

The simplicity that Stratis provides can be seen when comparing the CLI
commands used for create a filesystem that encrypts data-at-rest, to the
method an advanced user would use to configure each layer separately:

Stratis commands to create an encrypted pool and filesystem:

`stratis key set testkey --capture-key`

`enter passphrase`

`stratis pool create p1 --key-desc testkey /dev/sdb`

`stratis fs create p1 fs1`

Commands an advanced user would use to configure a similar filesystem:

`cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/sdb`

`in TUI type YES`

`enter passphrase`

`verify passphrase`

`cryptsetup -v luksOpen /dev/sdb luks-device`

`pvcreate /dev/mapper/luks-device`

`vgcreate -L100 -n lv1 vg1`

`mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/lv1-vg1`

### API Example ###

Stratis has also built an API for developers to implement the storage
management features directly into their project.  The benefits to developers
interested in using Stratis and its API would be:

* It provides a feature rich file system and storage management API
* Well designed and tested code ensures the developer can work on the important
details of their project
* Moves the responsibility of maintaining code for setting up storage to the Stratis project.

Here is an example of how to call Stratis API using the busctl utility from a
command-line

Create a pool:

`busctl call org.storage.stratis3 /org/storage/stratis3 org.storage.stratis3.Manager.r0 CreatePool &quot;s(bq)as(bs)(b(ss))&quot; poolname 0 0 2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb 0 &quot;&quot; 0 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;`

Print version:

`busctl get-property org.storage.stratis3 /org/storage/stratis3 org.storage.stratis3.Manager.r0 Version`

Print engine state:

`busctl call org.storage.stratis3 /org/storage/stratis3 org.storage.stratis3.Manager.r0 EngineStateReport‚Äù`

Get ManageObjects:

`busctl call org.storage.stratis3 /org/storage/stratis3 org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager GetManagedObjects`
