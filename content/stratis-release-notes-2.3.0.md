Stratis 2.3.0 adds additional flexibility to its encryption support via
Clevis [clevis].

stratis 2.3.0
-------------
This release extends the `pool unlock` command, and adds two new commands,
`pool bind` and `pool unbind`.

The `pool bind` command establishes an alternative mechanism for unlocking
a pool. The user may select either the "tang" mechanism, which implements
NBDE (Network-bound Disc Encryption) by means of a Tang server, or the
"tpm2" mechanism, which uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) encryption.
Binding the devices in a pool to a supplementary Clevis encryption policy does
not remove the primary encryption mechanism, which uses a key in the kernel
keyring.

The `pool unbind` command simply unbinds a previously added encryption
policy from all the devices in the specified pool.

In the `pool unlock` command it is now necessary to specify the mechanism.
Use `clevis` to make use of the Clevis unlocking policy previously
specified for the devices in the pool. Use `keyring`, to make use of the
mechanism that uses a key in the kernel keyring, which was introduced
in Stratis 2.1.0. Note that the `pool unlock` command unlocks all currently
locked pools.

stratisd 2.3.0
--------------
This release introduces two D-Bus interface revisions, which differ in the
following way from the previous revisions.

`org.storage.stratis2.Manager.r3` modifies the `UnlockPool` method to take
an additional parameter, `unlock_method`, which may be `keyring` or `clevis`.

`org.storage.stratis2.pool.r3` adds two new method: `Bind` and `Unbind`.
The `Bind` method takes two arguments, `pin` and `json`. The `pin` argument
designates the Clevis pin as a string, and the `json` argument encodes
a Clevis configuration appropriate to the designated pin. The configuration
is a JSON object. Besides Clevis information, it may include Stratis-specific
keys that encode configuration decisions that Stratis may implement. At
present there is just one such key: `stratis:tang:trust_url`.
The `Unbind` method reverses a `Bind` action.

Remarks
-------

The `Bind` method may be called with any Clevis pin and configuration;
we expect that any valid Clevis pin and configuration can be used to bind the
devices in a pool. However the Stratis project officially supports only the
"tang" and "tpm2" pins as those are the pins that may be designated via
`stratis`. Support for additional Clevis policies may be introduced into
`stratis` in later releases.

When binding a supplementary encryption policy to the devices in a pool
using Clevis, the primary key, which is the key in the kernel keyring which
was originally used to encrypt each device, must be supplied. stratisd
obtains the appropriate key from the kernel keyring in order to provide it
to the Clevis binding mechanism. The correct key must be present in the
keyring for the bind operation to succeed. It is not necessary for the user
to specify the key, stratisd obtains the necessary information from the
LUKS2 metadata on the devices in the pool.

In general, it is unwise to write a key consisting of arbitrary binary data
to a keyfile. An accidental newline character in the data may cause the
contents of the file to be truncated at the newline when read in one context
while all the data may be read from the file in some other context.

We are not aware that such a mistake would result in any error in Stratis's
operation when Stratis is used in the way that we recommend. We explicitly
acknowledge that it might be possible, through some direct interaction with
the stratisd D-Bus API, or by, e.g., setting a key in the kernel keyring
without using stratis, to manufacture a situation where stratisd could not
bind the devices in a pool, even when the correct key is set in the kernel
keyring. We would not treat such a situation as evidence of a bug in Stratis.
